# ApexLink Banking - Enhanced Print/Export Reports Documentation

## Overview
The ApexLink Banking application now includes comprehensive print and export functionality for all report types. Each report tab has its own dedicated, professional A4 print layout that can be printed as an account statement.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dedicated Print Layouts
Each report type now has its own professional print layout:

- **Financial Summary Report** - Complete financial overview with key metrics, account summary, loan portfolio, profitability analysis, and performance ratios
- **Account Analytics Report** - Account portfolio overview, account type analysis, performance metrics, and key insights
- **Loan Portfolio Report** - Portfolio summary, financial overview, risk analysis, loan status distribution, and KPIs
- **Transaction Summary Report** - Transaction volume summary, daily averages, detailed daily transactions, and insights
- **Customer Metrics Report** - Customer base overview, engagement metrics, top customers, segmentation analysis, and executive summary

### 2. Professional A4 Formatting

### 3. Smart Print Function
- **Selective Printing**: Only prints the layout for the currently selected report tab
- **Clean Output**: Removes scrollbars and browser UI elements during printing
- **Responsive**: Automatically adjusts for different content sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Print Layout Components
Each report type has its own React component:
- `FinancialSummaryPrintLayout`
- `AccountAnalyticsPrintLayout`
- `LoanPortfolioPrintLayout`
- `TransactionSummaryPrintLayout`
- `CustomerMetricsPrintLayout`

### Shared Print Styles
- **PrintStyles Component**: Contains all CSS styles for print media
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures content fits properly on A4 pages
- **Print-specific CSS**: Hidden on screen, visible only when printing
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Works with all modern browsers

### Print Function Logic
```typescript
const printReport = () => {
  // Get the current report's print layout ID
  const printLayoutId = `${selectedReport}-print`;
  const currentPrintLayout = document.getElementById(printLayoutId);
  
  // Show only the current report's layout
  // Remove scrollbars and browser UI
  // Trigger print dialog
  // Restore original styles after printing
}
```
