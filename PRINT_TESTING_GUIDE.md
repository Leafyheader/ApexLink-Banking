## How to Test the Print Layouts

### 1. Manual Testing Steps

3. Login with admin credentials if needed
4. Select any report tab (Financial Summary, Account Analytics, etc.)
5. Wait for the report data to load
6. Click the "Print" button in the top-right corner
7. In the browser's print preview, verify:
   - Only the report content is visible
   - No tabs, filters, buttons, or other UI elements
   - Professional A4 layout with proper formatting
   - Company header and report title
   - Clean, business-appropriate design

### 2. What Should Be Hidden in Print

### 7. Troubleshooting
If UI elements still appear in print:
